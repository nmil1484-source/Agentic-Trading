# Trades & Autonomous Cycle Log

Append-only log for the Agentic Account (••••8058). Every autonomous Routine cycle (CLAUDE.md
§14) logs one entry here, whether or not it results in a trade. Manually-confirmed trades from
this chat should also be logged here at the time they're placed, for a single source of truth on
the 1/day and 3/week new-position caps (§3) and the daily/weekly realized-loss circuit breakers
(§6).

Format per entry:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC — [AUTONOMOUS | MANUAL]
- Tickers reviewed:
- Gate results (LUC/FTA/technical/catalyst):
- Outcome: OBSERVE (reason) | TRADE (ticker, qty, limit, stop, target, RR, source links)
- Account state after: equity, cash, open positions, today's/this week's new-position count

## 2026-08-13 08:17 UTC — AUTONOMOUS (test-fire, self-bound Routine verification)
- Account check: Agentic Account ••••8058 confirmed (agentic_allowed=true). Equity $277.00,
  100% cash, no open positions (get_portfolio, get_equity_positions). Retail account ••••7533
  correctly agentic_allowed=false, not touched.
- Circuit breakers (§6): no daily equity decline (equity up vs. last known $200 — likely a
  deposit, not a loss), 0 consecutive MCP errors, positions reconcile (empty = empty). Clear.
- New-position counts (§3): 0 today, 0 this week (log was empty). Not at cap.
- FTA Regime Dashboard (https://fta-regime-dashboard.onrender.com/), checked 2026-08-13 08:17 UTC:
  UNKNOWN — loading placeholders only, no live classification returned.
- LUC status computed from known buy-zone thresholds vs. fresh quotes (same session-verified
  math as the manual research earlier today): TSLA GREEN, HIMS GREEN, DUOL GREEN, LMND GREEN;
  AMD/NVDA/AMZN/SHOP/MU/HOOD/PLTR/SPY/QQQ all RED (price above "do not buy above" zone);
  IREN/PATH WHITE (neutral). No material price movement since the last check this session — still
  pre-market (~04:17 ET), before regular hours open.
- Outcome: **OBSERVE — no trade.** FTA Regime Dashboard UNKNOWN blocks execution per §6 ("if
  data is... unavailable, do not infer a bullish signal and do not propose execution"),
  independent of any individual ticker's LUC/technical picture. Also moot this instant: market is
  pre-open, so §4's new-position timing window doesn't apply yet regardless.
- Account state after: equity $277.00, cash $277.00, 0 open positions, 0/1 new positions today,
  0/3 this week.
- Note: this was a manually-triggered test-fire of the self-bound autonomous Routine (not a
  scheduled firing) to verify the fresh-session tool-access failure from the first attempt didn't
  recur. It didn't — Robinhood MCP and git push both worked correctly in this session.

## 2026-08-13 14:50 UTC — AUTONOMOUS (scheduled cycle)
- Account check: Agentic Account ••••8058 confirmed (agentic_allowed=true). Equity $277.00,
  100% cash, no open positions. No change since last cycle.
- Circuit breakers (§6): no daily equity decline, 0 consecutive MCP errors, positions reconcile.
  Clear.
- New-position counts (§3): 0 today, 0 this week. Not at cap.
- FTA Regime Dashboard (https://fta-regime-dashboard.onrender.com/), checked 2026-08-13 14:50
  UTC: still loading placeholders, no live classification. Classified **UNKNOWN_DEGRADED** per
  the updated §5/§6 rule — logged, not treated as bearish, does not block on its own. Compensating
  requirement in effect: reward-to-risk floor is ≥1:3 (not ≥1:2) for any proposal this cycle.
- Market timing (§4): regular session open, ~10:50am ET (~1h20m past open) — outside the
  first/last-15-minute exclusion windows.
- LUC status recomputed from known buy-zone thresholds vs. fresh quotes: TSLA GREEN ($333.39 vs.
  $338 first-buy-zone ceiling), HIMS GREEN ($29.70, within 2nd buy zone), DUOL GREEN ($135.75,
  still below the $145 load-the-boat zone), LMND GREEN ($51.905, within first buy zone). AMD/
  NVDA/AMZN/SHOP/MU/HOOD/PLTR/SPY/QQQ all RED (further above their do-not-buy lines than last
  cycle — broad market strength today). IREN/PATH still WHITE.
- Technical scorecard (§13) on the closest candidate, TSLA: 9-day EMA ($327.13, Aug 12 close)
  still below the 20-day EMA ($337.48) — gap has narrowed to ~$10.35 but has NOT crossed. §13.B
  is a hard gate ("only propose a long entry when the 9-period average is above the 20-period
  average") — intraday rally to $333.39 doesn't count until a daily candle actually closes with
  the average relationship flipped. **TSLA fails the gate, still OBSERVE.**
- HIMS, DUOL, LMND: no material new information since the full research pass logged earlier
  today in this chat (HIMS still post-earnings-miss selloff, technically bearish; DUOL's move is
  still an oversold bounce off a negative guidance cut, not a verified bullish catalyst; LMND
  still bearish EMA/MACD alignment). None re-checked in full depth this cycle since nothing
  material changed; will re-run full depth next cycle or on request.
- Outcome: **OBSERVE — no trade.** Closest candidate (TSLA) fails the §13.B 9/20 EMA hard gate;
  no other candidate clears LUC/technical/catalyst together. FTA UNKNOWN_DEGRADED noted but was
  not the blocking factor this cycle.
- Account state after: equity $277.00, cash $277.00, 0 open positions, 0/1 new positions today,
  0/3 this week.

## 2026-08-13 15:39 UTC — AUTONOMOUS (scheduled cycle)
- Account check: Agentic Account ••••8058 confirmed. Equity $277.00, 100% cash, no positions.
  No change since last cycle.
- Circuit breakers (§6): clear. New-position counts: 0/1 today, 0/3 this week. Not at cap.
- FTA Regime Dashboard, checked 2026-08-13 15:39 UTC: still loading placeholders. UNKNOWN_DEGRADED
  — logged, non-blocking, ≥1:3 RR compensating requirement in effect.
- Market timing: regular session, ~11:39am ET. Outside first/last-15-minute windows.
- LUC status recheck: TSLA GREEN ($333.19), HIMS GREEN ($29.32), DUOL GREEN ($136.30), LMND GREEN
  ($51.91) — unchanged. AMD/NVDA/AMZN/SHOP/MU/HOOD/PLTR/SPY/QQQ still RED. IREN still WHITE.
  **New this cycle: PATH flipped from WHITE to GREEN** ($15.03, now below its $15.19 first-buy-
  zone threshold vs. $16.91 do-not-buy line) — not yet run through the full §5/§13 gate (technical
  scorecard, catalyst, stop-loss); flagging for a full pass next cycle or on request, not treating
  as a candidate yet.
- TSLA technical recheck: 9-day EMA ($327.13) still below 20-day EMA ($337.48) as of the last
  completed close (Aug 12, unchanged from last cycle — no new daily bar has closed yet today).
  §13.B hard gate still not cleared.
- HIMS/DUOL/LMND: no material change from the standing analysis (HIMS bearish post-earnings-miss,
  DUOL's move still traced to a negative guidance cut rather than a verified bullish catalyst,
  LMND still bearish EMA/MACD alignment).
- Outcome: **OBSERVE — no trade.** Same blocker as last cycle (TSLA's 9/20 EMA gate not yet
  crossed); PATH is a new development worth a full research pass but wasn't run deep enough this
  cycle to reach a status.
- Account state after: equity $277.00, cash $277.00, 0 open positions, 0/1 new positions today,
  0/3 this week.
